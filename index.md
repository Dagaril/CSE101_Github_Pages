## Early childhood and Personal Life

I was born in **St. Petersburg, Russia** ~~in August of 2000~~, where I lived for the first 7 years of my life. In *2007* I moved to the San Diego, where I have lived ever since.
I have picked up numerous sports throughout my life, including:

- Fencing
- Karate
- Soccer

I have been tinkering with software since middle school, where I started out with Lego Mindstorms and have progressed to Arduinos and Raspberry Pi's. I consider my life motto to be
> What I do today sets me up for what I *can* do tomorrow

## Education

I currently attend UC San Diego, where I am working towards a Bachelor of Science in `Computer Science` with a minor in Cognitive Science :brain:
Since CS involves a lot of coding, I have chosen to include a for loop which does `nothing`:

```
for i in range(5):
  nothing()
